            <h2>What does it take to be classified as a planet?</h2>
			<p>According to NASA "A planet is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit."</p>
			
			<h2>Demotion of Pluto</h2>
			<p> On August 24th 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) demoted Pluto from planet status to that of a new classification - Dwarf Planet. According to NASA "A 'dwarf planet' is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, (c) has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit, and (d) is not a satellite."</p>
